Someone eventually thought to combine the merits of the two, and came up with the idea for the mace. It is really just a fabricated club, and while they were later perfected to be effective against armor (such as the case with the flanged mace), they were always dramatically inferior weapons (when compared to alternatives) - but extremely simple to use, requiring practically no training at all, which is why they remained popular and are in a sense, still in use! We've just altered the design and call them batons now.", 4);

Chainmail is extremely good armor for avoiding cuts and stabs, but unfortunately the tips of piercing weapons tend to stick through the chain-links, and even a cut that doesnâ€™t penetrate essentially still transfers most kinetic energy to the wearer,", 4);
